Smart Fire: AI-Powered Raspberry Pi for Early Fire Detection

Objective:
Develop a system that monitors air quality using an Raspberry Pi-based sensor array and utilizes the collected data, along with other environmental parameters, to predict forest fires using artificial intelligence.

Hypothesis:
With AI analysis of environmental data, it is possible to build a prototype that uses a Raspberry Pi to accurately predict forest fires by measuring air quality.

Ten of California’s twenty largest fires occurred in the last five years. The total cost of the 2018-19 wildfire season is estimated to be over 40 billion. 1 in 6 people at the epicenter of wildfires do not have access to cellular data, and consequently do not receive updates about fires. Even if the fire isn’t happening in the region, surrounding areas are often affected because the smoke spreads. With the advent of artificial intelligence, using predictive analysis has become a feasible idea. The general concept is to use previous years data to predict patterns, also accounting the air pollutants in the air. Wildfire smoke is a mixture of hazardous air pollutants, the primary ones being PM2.5, PM10, and CO₂. Factors such as air pressure, temperature, and humidity are also involved.
